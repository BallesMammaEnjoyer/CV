        <h1>
            Dear Mr. Factory Manager.
        </h1>
        <h2>
            My name is James Garfield Davis.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am applying for the position of Factory Quality Control at Källby Lasagna Factory.

I am very skilled in tasting and experiencing the pure essence of the lasagna. I have worked with lasagna my entire life and I have been a connoisseur of it for as long as I can remember. 

        </p>
        <p>
            I was employed as a poison tester for 15 years, almost constantly tasting high quality dishes. I have thus acquired an innate sense for every piece, every ingredient and exactly how a dish of lasagna was cooked. My skills are invaluable. I have also worked as a professional lasagna eater at a competition and thus I know how to quickly and efficiently consume a lasagna.

        </p>
        <p>
            I would describe myself as a humorous and quick witted “person”, although some describe me as arrogant. While I do not have a formal education I do see myself as intelligent and knowledgeable nonetheless. I can also speak with cats which may be useful if some decide to wander into the warehouse. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After my career as a professional lasagna eater I went into unemployment due to stress, overworking and simply to take a break. During this time I explored my inner self and why I love lasagna so much, and I also spent a lot of time with my owner, Jon, and his dog Odie. I felt a spiritual connection to this job when I saw it in the newspaper, as if it was made for me. 

        </p>
        <p>
            If I get this job then I know that I will be able to inspect every single lasagna going through that conveyor belt with expansive detail. I also offer myself to discard the lasagna which is not up to par with the rest as I have extensive knowledge in that subject.

        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, I feel that I am the perfect candidate for this position, in every way.
        </p>
